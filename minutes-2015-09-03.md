Agenda: 
  - organizing the talk series
  - giving a talk to the PIs 
  - brainstorm ways researchers can better organize data/analysis
  - organizing workshop series
  
Journal access on the CAMH network
  - Ongoing process to allow U of T vlan access

External website access on the CAMH network
  - Compucom is on it

"Research" Workstation/Laptop provided by CAMH
  - CAMH IT is on board, we can provide specs to Mark Cyrus 
  - Admin access still needs to be separately requested
  - Mac is excluded b/c compucom can't support them
  
CAMH-wide wiki
  - IT will build a sharepoint install for us
  - or, install mediawiki, etc.. 

Biostatistics service
  - costs $65/hr, detailed online request form
  - how often is this service used? (David will find out)
  - could be a model for research computing service? 

Research Computing talk series 
  - Possible to make announcements at rounds, but making a talk series as part of the rounds no possible
  - Mehrab will advertise a separate talk series
  - What topics? 
    - implementation problems of analysis
    - data management in analysis
    - pipelines, and pipeline development
    - data visualization, and analysis methods (e.g. GWAS)
    - universal methods
    - must show tools/code
    - must walk through an example/tutorial
  - video / website recording of talk
  - Yuliya and Ricardo and Daniel to organise speakers 
  
  
Building computing skills of researchers
  - more, and more frequent workshops
    - basic computing skills 
    - R
    
  - problem-based workshops
    - work through an example project, in multiple languages?
    - leave people with a working example they can adapt/use
    - researchers bring their code/analysis (intimidating?)
    
    
  - database of CAMH experts and their skills
    - allow researchers to find one other
    - schedule a workshop
  
  - discussion forum with topical subgroups led by CAMH experts
    - code review section
   
  - survey labs to find out who codes and who take advantage of workshops/code-review
  
  - screencasts of experts working? 
  
  - mandatory training 
    - for use of the SCC ("drivers license"), but must balance skill required and use
    - might turn people off -- extra barrier
    - the Tao of computing
