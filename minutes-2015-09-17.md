## Agenda: 
 - Follow-up from last week 
   1. Research methods talk series (Ricardo/Yuliya/Daniel)
     - David is presenting at the Research Education Rounds, could participate or advertise? 
     - Ricardo has sent a list of dates to solicit speakers
     - 
   2. Research Orientation - Meeting with research orientation team to possibly include mandatory skills training (or just including additional offerigs during orientation week)
   3. SciNet Courses - Reached out to IMS, School of Graduate Studies, School of Continuing Studies and SciNet.
   4. Survey - Natalia has prepared a survey based on the few questions generated last meeting (can be added to and disseminated)
 - Discuss group aims/projects


## A summary of our brainstorming, and a proposal
### Issues/solutions clusters
1. **Managing lab digital assets**: software versions, data, ongoing and completed analyses
 - Addressed by: wiki, version control (e.g github/gitlab), sharing of best practices
  
2. **Poor computational literacy of researchers**
 - Addressed by: training, face-to-face support personnel, informal/formal meetings and talk series, wiki/forum

3. **Maintaining and sharing know-how** (organisational memory)
 - Addressed by: wiki, meetings and talks, training
 
4. **Making better use of computing resources**
 - Addressed by: training, face-to-face support personnel, access to Compute Canada resources
 
5. **Brute technical hinderances** (e.g. wifi access to the SCC, journal access)
 - Addressed by: communication with Research IT

6. **Discovering unmet needs of researchers**
 - Addressed by: lab survey, meetings and talk series, forum, face-to-face support personnel

### Possible group aims
1. Organise social and academic events to catalyse discussion and sharing of know-how (peer-support)
 - Talk series, workshops, office hours, invited speakers/training
 
2. Advocate for institutional/structural changes to improve scientific computing support
 - Make the case for money for more support staff in labs, a computing support service, etc..
 - Get software and computing on the research agenda of CAMH, and into PI grants, etc..
 - Request software/infrastructure: e.g. hosted version control
 
3. Advisory board of researchers to offer guidance and ideas for research IT directions
 - Act as an informed group of researchers (and perhaps a conduit for other researchers) to help guide Research IT in purchasing and staffing decisions
 - Help review and shape computing purchasing decisions from labs and institutions

4. Build/adapt the software needed for CAMH specific research, and support the researchers
 - Hold hackathons and or advocate for 20% time for computing experts to devote to in-house development projects
 - Work alongside researchers to learn about methods, and improve coding/packaging/publish good code
 
### Group vision/mission

> The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class  research.
>
> We help people build better software, and we work with researchers, developers, funders and infrastructure providers to identify key issues and best practice in scientific software.

- www.software.ac.uk

> The Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF) is [...] devoted to improving basic computing skills among researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and other disciplines.

### Next steps
1. Wiki-survey (review next week)
2. Talk series (schedule)
3. Workshop series (room availability)
4. Obtain legitimacy :D
 - Demonstrate one successful case where we've helped (Yuliya, Brice!)
 - Letter to request our status as an advisory board? 
 - One-on-one interviews with Damien/Bruce/Catherine about our group aims
