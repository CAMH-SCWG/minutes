## A summary of our brainstorming, and a proposal
### Issues/solutions clusters
1. Managing lab digital assets: software versions, data, ongoing and completed analyses
 - Addressed by: wiki, version control (e.g github/gitlab), sharing of best practices
  
2. Poor computational literacy of researchers
 - Addressed by: training, face-to-face support personnel, informal/formal meetings and talk series, wiki

3. Maintaining and sharing know-how (organisational memory)
 - Addressed by: wiki, meetings and talks, training
 
4. Making better use of computing resources
 - Addressed by: training, face-to-face support personnel
 
5. Brute technical hinderances (e.g. wifi access to the SCC, journal access)
 - Addressed by: communication with Research IT
