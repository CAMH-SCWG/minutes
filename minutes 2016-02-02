## Agenda: 

# Minutes from Feb 2, 2016

###GITlab 
  - can be found at RDRSHGITLABV.CAMH.CA or 172.28.216.58
  - cannot be accessed from CAMH Guest or Transforming Lives wireless
  - Qing took a look at enabling LFS
  - Currently donâ€™t have domain name properly registered, but should be able to do so
  - Ishraq tested: tried using LFS with camh server, and even if used SSH connection, had to use HTTP (re-type in credentials)
  - So camh repeatedly asked for username and password. Tried using same LFS commands with gitlab, and that worked. But, could still clone a repository 
  - So, when initialize on the server, should work
  - _Next step_: Qing is comfortable will be gitlab reliable. Needs to find a solution for the email. This is the next step, but messy with camh. Might need to find work around
  - At present, anyone can make a gitlab account.  So user access will have to be set on case-by-case basis

###Storage

  - Qing: moving along
  - David is identifying a few groups to test
  - Some groups are testing NFS sites
  - Should be announced pretty soon

###FTP 

  - Compucom has to do some work on the firewall. Can transfer 14mg/s on average inside, but if on other side of firewall, it breaks
  - This, it isnot usable
  - Andy is looking at GLOBUS. A lot of ports are involved. Again, firewall issues

###Peers to Peers

  - Continue to follow up with speakers
  - Some new ideas (gitlab and github, latek and markdown, etc)
  - We will forward email address, topic, availability to P2P

###Next week/ followup:
