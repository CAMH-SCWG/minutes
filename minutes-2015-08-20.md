# Next meeting: 27 August, 3-4pm, Room 801 
## Agenda: 
- Review last week's brainstorm
- Report back about actions
- Continue brainstorm/actions

# Minutes
## Group actions: 
- **Peter** to bring ice cream to the next meeting :D
- **Peter** to also find out cost for CAMH biostatistics service, and invite them
- **Yuliya** to speak to Melissa Levesque about us presentating at Research rounds
- **Jon** to speak to David about SCC connectivity on CAMH TransformingLives wifi
- **Joe** to look into surveying labs on their "workflows" (see below)

## Computing issues we've identified: 
- Managing lab software “bits and pieces” (how to document and organize)
- Lack of computing skills of researchers
- How to best organize computational analyses
- Maintain organizational memory (best practices) -- e.g. wiki
- Underuse of computing power
- Moving data from T drive to non-CAMH networked computers

## Idea brainstorm of solutions to address issues:
### Understand the problem better
- Survey workflows across labs to find out what is done and needed: **[Joe to
  investigate]**
  - how are people doing their work? (OS, software, ...)
  - what are hinderences, e.g. are people working from home because of network
    connectivity issues?
  - what are best practices for issues above. 

### Improve access to technology
- Journals should be accessible to researchers on the CAMH network
- Researchers should be able to mount storage on non-CAMH workstations
  - both in the RIC and outside of the RIC. 
  - is there a PHI issue?
- CAMH provided “research workstation” (Windows and/or Mac/Linux) that has: 
  - admin access, for software installs
  - journal access
  - common research tools
- Remote desktop access to the SCC
- Remote desktop access to a research VM to enable custom software/environment
- CAMH wifi connection to the SCC should work [Jon to ask David]
- Modernize the SCC OS (since packages hard to compile already)
- Custom OS per lab on the SCC 

### More talk between lab experts to share institutional knowledge
- Creating a venue for knowledge sharing
- Central portal for labs to share knowledge/practices (on the Research IT
  portal?)
- SCC User Group (message board/mailing list) for help/feedback
* socials with ice cream (low fat option for Peter) *

### Face-to-face computing support in each lab
- floating few experts avail to each lab
- expert per lab?
- experts should know how to navigate ResearchIT, and analysis best practices,
  etc.
- experts can assist in sharing knowledge between labs
- need people to go for “advanced” analysis/statistics help (stuff that is not
  easily google-able)
- A “free” biostatistics service **[Peter to find out current cost]**
- Faster responses to SCC requests or else people won't bother
- One member from lab having “admin” access on the SCC to install packages,
  etc.. (Perhaps a sandboxed area for admins to add to the quarantine)

### Legitimacy/advocacy of this issue: 
- Invite the SCC admin to this group, and also David or else worry that this
  group has no legitimacy/voice **[Jon to ask David]**
- Present at Research Rounds to let lab heads hear about these issues, bet buy
  in **[Yuliya to ask Melissa]**
