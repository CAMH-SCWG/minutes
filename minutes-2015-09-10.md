Agenda:

1. Update on the research computing talk series (Yuliya/Ricardo/Daniel G).
2. Organizing workshop series in October/November
  Dates, instructors,next steps?
3. Brainstorm ways we could improve how researchers organize data/analysis

Minutes from Sept 3, 2015
Status of journal access on the CAMH network
David: Ongoing process to allow U of T VLAN access
        -> New Research VLA has been assigned
        no other journal access is planned 
    -> Inquired with Research Services Anita Dubey 

External website access on the CAMH network

    Compucom is on it
      -> Call yesterday to review access at an organizational level
      -> Ticket placed with GTANet

"Research" Workstation/Laptop provided by CAMH

    CAMH IT is on board with this idea
    -> Marvin Boothe (Service Delivery) will support new builds (pending specifications are gathered). 
    -> New images can be created and maintained with "Research Specific Software". 
    -> Qing and Mark investigating. 
    Admin access would still needs to be separately requested
    Mac is excluded b/c compucom won't support them
    Otherwise, researchers can work with Mark Cyrus to spec out individual machines they'd like to purchase

Implementing a CAMH-wide wiki

    IT will build a sharepoint install for us
    or, install mediawiki, etc..
    no one is interested in championing this idea, so we'll leave it for now.

Status of the CAMH Biostatistics service

    costs $65/hr, has a detailed online request form (which Peter approves of)
    How often is this service used? (David will find out)
    -> Cannot share these numbers at the moment.
    If it's not being used often, perhaps it needs to be advertised more, be made less expensive, or... ?
    could this service be a model for a research computing service?
    -> Ongoing project within Research IT 

Research Computing talk series

    Yuliya: possible to make announcements at rounds, but making a talk series as part of the rounds is not possible.
    Mehrab will advertise a separate talk series for us if we'd like.
    What topics? A mini brainstorm:
        implementation problems of analysis
        data management in analysis
        pipelines, and pipeline development
        data visualization, and analysis methods (e.g. GWAS)
        universal methods
        must show tools/code
        must walk through an example/tutorial
    CAMH AV could video record talks, and we could post online?
    Yuliya and Ricardo and Daniel G to organise speakers
    -> [UPDATES]

Brainstorm of ways to build computing skills of researchers

    more, and more frequent workshops
        basic computing skills
        R

    problem-based workshops
        work through an example project, in multiple languages?
        leave people with a working example they can adapt/use
        researchers bring their code/analysis (intimidating?)

    database of CAMH experts and their skills
        allow researchers to find one other
        schedule a workshop
        -> Natalia has previously agreed to provide instruction. 

    discussion forum with topical subgroups led by CAMH experts
        code review section

    survey labs to find out who codes and who take advantage of workshops/code-review

    screencasts of experts working?

    mandatory training
        for use of the SCC ("drivers license"), but must balance skill required and use
        might turn people off -- extra barrier
        the Tao of computing
        -> Inquired with Lisa Johnston (Research Orientation Integration).
